"Delivery App"
My application, "Delivery App," is a mobile platform developed using Flutter,
designed to simplify the process of ordering food and products from local restaurants and businesses.
The application provides a user-friendly interface, that allows customers to browse menus,
add items to their shopping carts, place orders, and track deliveries. Key features include multile language (English/Italian),
a (light/dark) mode toggle for a more personalized experience, and a drawer menu for easy navigation between sections like Home, Orders,
Restaurants, and Language Preferences. With these functionalities,
the application aims to deliver a seamless and efficient experience for customers and businesses.
The application is designed to offer a simple and user-friendly experience. When users open the application,
they are welcomed by a home screen that features a logo, a friendly message, and a button to explore the menu. 
From the navigation drawer, users can easily access common actions such as:
Browsing the Menu:
Users can access the "Menu" option to explore the list of items available for ordering.
Placing an Order: 
By navigating to the "Orders" section, users can review their selected items and confirm  their purchase.
Exploring Restaurants: 
The "Restaurants" section provides a list of nearby dining options for users to browse.
Changing the Language:
The "Change Language" option in the drawer, users can easily switch between supported languages(English/Italian).
Toggling Dark Mode: 
A convenient switch in the drawer enables users to activate dark mode for a more comfortable viewing experience.
The technology used to build my "Delivery App" involves several Flutter/Dart packages that enhance its functionality and user experience.
provider (^6.0.5) :
Used for state management, this package allows the app to efficiently handle and update its state, when managing user data like orders. 
It ensures that any changes in data, such as placing an order.
intl_utils (version 2.8.7):
This package facilitates localization, making it easier to manage multiple languages within the app. It helps the generation of localization files,
enabling users to switch seamlessly between languages such as (English/Italian).
http (version 0.13.3): 
This package is essential for managing HTTP requests. Although the application may not currently connect with a remote server,
it is included to support future network interactions,such as fetching restaurant data or submitting orders.
